# 🩺 Diagnostiq

An AI-powered diagnostic assistant that bridges the communication gap between clinicians and patients by transforming real-time conversations into structured medical insights.

## Inspiration

We wanted to create a tool that helps clinicians and patients communicate more effectively. Doctors spend significant time documenting patient visits, while patients often struggle to understand medical terminology.

Our goal with Diagnostiq is to bridge that gap by analyzing conversations, capturing critical information, and providing clear, structured insights that benefit both clinicians and patients.

##  What It Does

Diagnostiq captures and analyzes doctor–patient conversations to:

-  Convert speech to structured text
- Highlight key symptoms
- Generate patient-friendly summaries
- Link prescribed medications to retailers such as Walmart, CVS, and Amazon
- Export EMR-ready medical reports
- Support voice command interaction for accessibility

##  How We Built It

Diagnostiq was developed using:

- **VS Code** – Primary development environment  
- **React** – Interactive frontend dashboard  
- **Featherless AI** – Backend AI processing for medical data extraction and summarization  
- **GitHub** – Version control and collaboration
